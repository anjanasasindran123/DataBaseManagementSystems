1. Write an insert command for inserting into a table only specific data i.e. Only data for a 
specific set of attributes. 


INSERT INTO ti (id,name) VALUES (1,'Anjana');

2. Write a single insert command to insert multiple rows. 

                 insert into ti values(2,'Anjana','kerala'),(3,'tina','Kerala');
             
3. For the instructor relation, modify the column called salary to type numeric(8,2). 
What does this datatype signify? 
alter table Instructor alter column salary type numeric(8,2);

numeric(8,2) means a precision of 8 and a scale of 2 ,that is it can have 6 digits before the decimal point and 2 digits after the decimal point.
4. Write an Insert into instructor table with salary field value as NULL. 
              insert into Instructor values('A6','Anjana','cse',NULL);
       
5. Perform an average operation on the salary field. Find out if its inclusive of the NULL 
value. What's your finding? 
select avg(salary) from Instructor ;

avg function does'nt include columns with a null value.But instead if we have used sum(salary)/count(*) it would have counted the null values and given a different output.

6. Write a query of your choice to depict the purpose of the keyword 'distinct' 
 select distinct salary from Instructor order by salary; 

7. Write a single update command for updating multiple attributes. 
                update Instructor set Iname="ANJANA",dept_name="CSE" ,salary=2000 where Iid="A5"; 
8. Create a table called result with the attributes 
(sid, cid, sem, year, int_marks_obtained,ext_marks_obtained, max_marks). Max_marks is 
the max. marks a student can obtain in that course. Sid – Student_id, Cid – Course_id. Write 
a check constraint which ensures that total_marks_obtained is less than max_marks. 

Create table result(
				sid int,cid varchar(5),
				year int,
				int_marks_obtained int,
				ext_marks_obtained int,
			       max_marks int,
		              check((int_marks_obtained
			       +ext_marks_obtained)<max_marks));
9. What's the answer to this query: 
select * from instructor order by 2;

It displays the table arranged in the ascending order of column 2.
10. What's the difference between char and varchar?

Varchar is variable length whereas char  is of fixed length.

11. Create tables called as instructors_doing_research(faculty_id, research_area) 
instructors_managing_projects(Iid, project_title) 
Write a query to find out the instructors who are not doing research (Hint: Use Minus) 
select Iid from Instructor minus select faculty_id from  instructors_doing_research;
12. Write a query using the above tables to find out the instructors who are doing research or 
those who are managing projects. 

  select distinct Iname from Instructor ,indr,inmp where Instructor.Iid=indr.faculty_id or Instructor.Iid=inmp.Iid; 
13. Write a query to find out only those instructors who are doing both research as well as 
managing projects. 
Construct the relational schema for your project. Upload the schema. (One submission per group) 

select  Iname from Instructor ,indr,inmp where Instructor.Iid=indr.faculty_id and Instructor.Iid=inmp.Iid;
